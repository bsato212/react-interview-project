# react-interview-project

Welcome! This challenge will help us gauge your knowledge and evaluate your frontend development skills. In this repo, you will find the instructions for developing a React application.

## Core Goals

The core goal is to create a simple but functional single page web application using React. This application will consult the [Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) and display detailed information about different cat breeds.

The main landing page should display cards with the name and image of 5 breeds picked randomly. Clicking any breed should lead to a detail page where all information about the breed should be displayed. The application should also implement a search box either in the main page or top header allowing queries by breed name. Clicking on a search result should lead to its detail page.

Root route should lead to the main page and there should also be routes for detail pages with a slugfied breed name.

- React SPA
- Redux for state management
- Prefer functional components

The core goals should be completed in full.

## Constraints

- Use latest React version
- Project must be created on top a clean [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev)
- Fetch API for HTTP requests
- i18n and a11y are not required
- Feel free to use other libraries as long as the constraints above are honored

## Deliverables

- Public GIT repository with source code
- README file in repository detailing implementation
- Live application URL

## Stretch Goals

- Use fully themed components with dark-mode support
- Lazy loading by route
- Page transitions and animations
- Complete test coverage for all reducers
- Storybook for components
